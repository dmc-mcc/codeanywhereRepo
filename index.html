    To join the Code Institute team, you can click on the following link:
    https://app.codeanywhere.com/team/invite/codeinstitute-team/30b7ee13
    Then reload the page to ensure the invite has been submitted correctly.
    After that, check that your team is set to Codeinstitute (it may still remain as 'My Team') in the top-right corner.
    
    You'll need to create a new workspace in the new team, so make sure to add/commit/push any changes you have in your current workspace, or save them to a local text editor (e.g. Notepad or Pages).
    Make sure to have a copy of any files that are not pushed to the repo (such as the env.py file), as these will not be recreated in the new workspace.
